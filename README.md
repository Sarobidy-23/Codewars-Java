## Subject :
 1 - You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk only a single block for each letter (direction) and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

### Note: you will always receive a valid array (string in COBOL) containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only). It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).


 2 - Given an array of integers.
Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. 0 is neither positive nor negative.
If the input is an empty array or is null, return an empty array.
### Example :
For input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15], you should return [10, -65].


 3 - Johnny is working as an intern for a publishing company, and was tasked with cleaning up old code. He is working on a program that determines how many digits are in all of the page numbers in a book with pages from 1 to n (inclusive).
For example, a book with 4 pages has 4 digits (one for each page) while a 12-page book has 15 (9 for 1-9, plus 2 each for 10, 11, 12).
Johnny's boss, looking to futureproof, demanded that the new program be able to handle books up to 400,000,000,000,000,000 pages.
